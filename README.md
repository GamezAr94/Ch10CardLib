# Ch10CardLib
the module contains two classes. -Card: Representing a standard playing card, with a suit of club, diamond, heart, or spade, and rank that lies between ace and king -Deck: Representing a full deck of 52 cards, with access to cards by position in the deck and the capability to shuffle and display the deck.

The code in the second Branch implement a strongly typed Collection of Cards objects in a class called Cards, this version of the console application using Collections can be used with the same result as before, as the method signatures of Deck are unchanged.
Clients of this class library can now make use of the Cards collection class, however, rather than rely on arrays of Card objects â€” for example, to define hands of cards in a card game application.

# What I Learned
* creating a Card deck using enumerations.
* Use of an algorithm to shuffle the Deck of cards.
* Use of Collections, CollectionBase.
* Use of Indexers to a class to provide array-like access.
